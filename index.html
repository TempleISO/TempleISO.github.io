      <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Filip Šajinović, and I am an IT technician who has recently left their work position in search for a better one.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I've gained valuable hands-on experience during my time in the company I had worked at, handling everything from user support and remote troubleshooting, to administering both Linux and Windows servers. I’ve also worked with VoIP systems, supported specialized medical equipment, and managed networks including setting up and configuring various gear.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I'm a big-time Linux enthusiast who enjoys getting my hands dirty with both desktops and servers. My go-to distros are Mint and Arch.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I’m also passionate about networking. I’ve spent a good chunk of time messing with MikroTik, Cisco, and UniFi gear. My favourite would be Mikrotik as it allows me to configure it both from a CLI and a nicely-done GUI.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I work best in team environments, bouncing ideas around and learning from others, but I’m also more than happy getting lost in configs, shell scripts, or documentation on my own.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Always willing to learn and improve my existing skills, tackle new challenges and take a nap afterwards.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Outside my professional life, I'm a big-time music enjoyer and a gamer. I also play around with new technologies as I find it fun.
